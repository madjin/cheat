# AS ROOT:  Make sure to bind mount your proc and devices [while in directory to chroot]
mount /dev/ dev/ -o bind      # mount devices while in local root directory
mount /sys/ sys/ -o bind   
mount /proc/ proc/ -o bind
chroot ./ bin/zsh             # chroot will execute the shell in directory
mount /dev dev/ -o bind; mount /sys/ sys/ -o bind; mount /proc/ proc/ -o bind; chroot ./ bin/zsh

#Access GUI applications
export DISPLAY=:0.0    # in chroot shell
xhost +                # in system shell

# Suppose you want to run Firefox in chroot jail to avoid security problems with signed Java applets
# and other components which could have access to your personal files. You could:
gksudo chroot /var/chroot firefox -DISPLAY=:0.0

# If you want the chroot to have its own display, can use Xnest command [download xhost/xnest]
# Ensure that /proc is mounted and DNS resolution is set-up within the chroot
#
Xnest -ac :1                  # into a terminal 
sudo chroot /var/chroot       # into another terminal
export DISPLAY=localhost:1    # while in chroot shell [if have problem, use 127.0.0.1]

# can start window manager inside chroot and should appear inside the chroot!
